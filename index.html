        <h1>Unit circle Trigonometric ratios</h1>
        <p>
            Trigonometry deals with the relationships between angles and ratios between the side-lengths of right angled triangles.
            If we take a right-angled triangle ABC where angle B is 90 degrees, the sine of an angle is defined as the ratio between the opposite side and the hypotenuse.
            That is, sin angle A = opposite / hypotenuse = BC/AB
        </p>
        <p>
            Insert sine and cos sketch
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, cos angle A = adjacent / hypotenuse = AC/AB
        </p>
        <p>
            A tool often used to introduce trigonometric ratios is the unit circle.
            Imagine a circle of radius 1 unit centered at the origin (0, 0). A right angled triangle can be drawn with these three points:
            <ul>
                <li>The center of the circle, (0, 0)</li>
                <li>Any point on the circumference of the circle, say (x, y)</li>
                <li>A point on the X-axis, ie, (0, y)</li>
            </ul>

            Using these three points, a right angled triangle can be drawn with any (x, y) on the circumference of the circle! Try it yourself below!
        </p>
        <p>
            Insert mouse moving triangle sketch with all three points defined
        </p>
        <p>
            A right-angled triangle drawn this way has the unique characteristic that it's hypotenuse is always of length 1 unit.
            So the sine and cosine can be simplified in this instance to be exactly equal to the length of the opposite side and the length of the adjacent side respectively!
